# Project -title
The Borrowing Items and Check-in System of the Software Engineering Lab (BICS-SEL). A innovative system designed to optimize resource management inside the Software Engineering Lab at Mae Fah Luang University is the Borrowing and Check-in System of the Software Engineering Lab (BICS-SEL). An effective solution is urgently needed to streamline the borrowing and returning procedure while guaranteeing data correctness, user convenience, and security in view of the rising demand for lab supplies, equipment, and tools. With a user-friendly interface and real-time tracking capabilities, BICS-SEL tackles this problem head-on and improves the whole borrowing and returning experience.

The SiamYim group is dedicated to establishing the Borrowing and Returning Material Equipment System (BICS-SEL) in order to meet the needs of users within the material and equipment borrowing industry. The BICS-SEL will be used to collect and manage statistical data related to material and equipment borrowing.
